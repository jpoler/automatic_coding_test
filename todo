SIMPLE FEATURES
[ ] only warn when location is before the event (currently it is just ST_DWITHIN)
[ ] authentication/session-tokens
[ ] make tests randomized (e.g. simulate GPS error better)
[ ] refactor queries
[ ] be consistent with use of conn, engine, session (go with conn for now)
NOT-SO-SIMPLE FEATURES
[ ] new endpoint for POSTing new trip information via json object
[ ] better support for real-life behavior (turning on to a new route, sitting at lights, ...)
[ ] test to make sure that at every point along route, the exactly correct messages are given
PERFORMANCE
[ ] diagnose why the queries are sluggish
[ ] research and implement spatial indexing
